Latin\_Loop
==========

According to urban legend, if you were to click on the first link of any Wikipedia article and do this continuously, eventually every article on Wikipedia will link back to the Philosophy article. I have found this to be false: most articles links back to a loop beginning (or at least mainly identified by) the Latin article (this includes the Philosophy article).

Using depth-first-search, this project seeks to validate the existence of the Latin loop. This project will start small and grow larger. The following is a list of intended landmarks:

1. Create a basic program that, given a valid English Wikipedia article will perform a depth-first-search of the article's links until it reaches the "Latin-Loop."
    * Make a Java CLI Program
    * Make a JavaFX Program
2. Perform this analysis on a Wikipedia data dump and graph out the results in graphviz

This page will expand as results come in.
